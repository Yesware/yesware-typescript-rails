# TypeScript for Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/typescript-ruby/typescript-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/typescript-ruby/typescript-rails) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/typescript-ruby/typescript-rails/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/typescript-ruby/typescript-rails)

This is a wrapper for the [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), JavaScript superset language by Microsoft.

It enables you to use the `.ts` extension in the Asset Pipeline and also in ActionView Templates.

This gem uses the
[typescript-node-ruby](https://github.com/typescript-ruby/typescript-node-ruby)
library by KAWACHI Takashi for the typescript parsing with node js.

The credit for the overall structure and the tests goes to the people that wrote the [coffee-rails](https://github.com/rails/coffee-rails) Gem, since I shamelessly copy&pasted some of their code.

## Requirements

The current version requires that [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is
installed on the system.

The requirement for node is tested upon starting the application. If
the node command is not available you get the following error message:

```
typescript-node requires node command, but it's not found. Please install it. Set TS_NODE environmental variable If you want to use node command in non-standard path.
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'typescript-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Just add a `.js.ts` file in your `app/assets/javascripts` directory and include it just like you are used to do. 

Files suffixed with `.tsconfig` will be treated as TypeScript project files, and the compiler options and source files included in the project file will be used to generate a .js file containing the concatenated output of the project compilation. NOTE: TypeScript >1.8 is required for this feature, since that version is the first to support custom `tsconfig` file paths (file names other than `tsconfig.json`). Since the `typescript-source` gem is still on 1.6, you must install TypeScript >1.8 through npm and set `TypeScript::Src.use_external_tsc = true` in your rails configuration.

Configurations:

```
# Its defaults are `--target ES5 --noImplicitAny`.
Typescript::Rails::Compiler.default_options = [ ... ]
```

## Referenced TypeScript dependencies

`typescript-rails` recurses through all [TypeScript-style](https://github.com/teppeis/typescript-spec-md/blob/master/en/ch11.md#1111-source-files-dependencies) referenced files and tells its [`Sprockets::Context`](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/blob/master/lib/sprockets/context.rb) that the TS file being processed [`depend`s`_on`](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#the-depend_on-directive) each file listed as a reference. This activates Sprocketâ€™s cache-invalidation behavior when any of the descendant references of the root TS file is changed.
